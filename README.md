# gpupassthrough
My passthrough config for Dell G5 SE (5505)

As of now, I have tried macOS Catalina 10.15.7. It seems the gpu isnt supported by the kernel. Im unsure whether this is caused by smartshift, treating the gpu to appear as an uncompatible chip for the mac kernel. I am not looking forward to switchoff amd smartshift unless an official BIOS-switch comes. Windows11 and 10 is to be tested and results will noted here.
